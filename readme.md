# Image manipulation library
(I'm still working on the name)
 
## Installation
Currently, there is no way to build a jar with one command. It's on the TODO list... I will (maybe) do it in some more or less distant future.
 
## Usage
There is two ways of using this project: the cli and in interractive mode.

### CLI


### Interractive mode
